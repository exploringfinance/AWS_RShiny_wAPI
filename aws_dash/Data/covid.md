During April, Tony recognized it was very challenging for individuals to get Covid Vaccine appointments. In response, he built a tool to scrape data from Walgreens, CVS, and local grocery stores to help individuals who qualified for a vaccine find appointments. He used a Gmail package to send automated emails every 5 minutes to people who signed up. The app is no longer running, but the interface can be found here: [https://atrevisan.shinyapps.io/vaccine/](https://atrevisan.shinyapps.io/vaccine/). Please note, this UI was put together very quickly and was not meant to be used for heavy traffic. More professional sites and dashboards can be provided upon request.

Below is the sample output from Walgreens. The website API searches within a 25 mile radius of the zip code(s) shown below. The table below would be filtered to show only the States selected by the user. The user would be directed to the [Vaccine Sign-up link](https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/vaccination/covid-19/location-screening).
